# load in genomes and selecty axis on whihc to work
# make sure they are in the sam eorder 

# merge on colnames will automate this step 


# basicly remodel s2

# then compute actual distances



# compute  distance predictors from distance matricies





# for each get the H, M, L regions




# then compare the associations of H,M,L regions
